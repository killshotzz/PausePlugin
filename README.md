# CS:GO Pause Plugin
Adds simple pause/unpause commands for players


This is an extremely simple plugin to add pause-commands for players that simply wrap the builtin mp_pause_match and mp_unpause_match commands. I didn't see one of those so I figured someone might have some use for it.

It adds sm_pause (!pause) and sm_unpause (!unpause) commands. Anyone can request a pause, and both teams (CT and T) must write !unpause to unpause.

It also adds admin commands sm_forcepause and sm_forceunpause to force pauses/unpauses.

Installation: just copy csgo_pause.smx into addons/sourcemod/plugins.

This plugin was built by: Splewis
And reworked by me to support more variations.
