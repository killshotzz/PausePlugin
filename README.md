# CS:GO Pause Plugin
Adds simple pause/unpause commands for players

This is an extremely simple plugin to add pause-commands for players that simply wrap the builtin pause system connected to commands.

It adds some simple commands that can be used by all players:

# Player Commands
> * sm_tech (!tech, !t)
> * sm_pause (!pause, !p, !tac, !tactical)
> * sm_unpause (!unpause, !up)

It also adds commands for admins to use:
# Admin Commands
> * sm_forcetechpause (!forcetechnical, !ftech, !ftec, ft)
> * sm_forcepause (!forcepause, !fp)
> * sm_forceunpause (!forceunpause, !fup)

# Installation
Simply download the latest build and paste the folder structure, to your server.
