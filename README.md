# CS:GO Pause Plugin
Adds simple pause/unpause commands for players

This is an extremely simple plugin to add pause-commands for players that simply wrap the builtin mp_pause_match and mp_unpause_match commands. I didn't see one of those so I figured someone might have some use for it.

It adds some simple commands that can be used by all players:

# Player Commands (Variations . / !)
* sm_tech (!tech, !t)
* sm_pause (!pause, !p, !tac, !tactical)
* sm_unpause (!unpause, !up)

It also addas commands for admins to use:
# Admin Commands (Variations: . / !)
* sm_forcetechpause (!forcetechnical, !ftech, !ftec, ft)
* sm_forcepause (!forcepause, !fp)
* sm_forceunpause (!forceunpause, !fup)

# Installation
Simply download the latest build and paste the folder structure, to your server.

This plugin was built by: Splewis
And reworked by me to support more variations.

# Changelog
* 1.0.1 - Rework of the plugin itself.
* 1.0.2 - Added translation files, fixed more variations of commands and cleaned up the code.

* To Do:
* - Add timer for pauses (30 seconds and the unpause)
* - Add limit for amount of pauses per team, per map
